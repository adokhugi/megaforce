TASSI: JACOB, wake up! We must hurry, it's already late!
JACOB: Oh, why, TASSI, oh why? Ah... I've forgot! It's the wedding of HANS and EVA today, right?
TASSI: Yes, my smart boy! So, c'mon! Let's get on!
JACOB: All right, Sir!
TASSI and JACOB make the journey to the cathedral where the wedding is taking place. Everybody is enjoying themselves and having fun until ... all of a sudden, a NINJA appears out of the dark and throws a shuriken at HANS! HANS breaks down... EVA bends over him and helps him with first aid...
TASSI: Come, JACOB! Let's chase this NINJA!
CARYN: I'm coming, too!
JACOB: We'll get that nasty fool!
TASSI, JACOB and CARYN are chasing the NINJA. After some minutes they arrive at a forest clearing. All of a sudden several BANANA men appear.
TASSI: JACOB, let's fight them!
JACOB: All right, Sir!
