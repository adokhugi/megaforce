After victory, the party searches the house for RUSSELL, but cannot find him. They only find a young woman, MONICA.
MONICA: Thanks for liberating me! RUSSELL kept me imprisoned.
TASSI: Where is RUSSELL?
MONICA: RUSSELL left some days ago in order to travel to a person named STANES. I don't know exactly, but as far as I know he was invited by STANES to spend the holidays there.
TASSI: Where is STANES located?
MONICA: STANES is living in Rogia.
TASSI: So, let's go to Rogia!
MONICA: I'll go with you.
MONICA the MAGE has joined the force.
On their way to Rogia the party has to cross a bridge.
GUARD: Stop! Crossing this bridge ain't free! You gotta pay a fee!
TASSI: How much is it?
GUARD: 10000 gold coins!
TASSI: We cannot afford that.
GUARD: Well, what a pity!
TASSI: But we must cross the bridge.
JACOB: Indeed. This bridge is the only way to Rogia.
TASSI: Let's force our way through!
GUARD: Alert! Intruders!
Several villains appear.
TASSI: Let's fight!
