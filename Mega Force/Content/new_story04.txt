JACOB: We defeated them! Great! Hopefully the doctors are doing their job.
A few days later the doctors call JACOB and EVA. HANS is fine again.
EVA: Thank you very much for curing my husband! Now it's time to enjoy the state of being married.
HANS: I don't think so.
EVA: WHAT?!
HANS: No, it's not because of you, EVA. It's because of those killers.
TASSI: Ah, yeah! We still don't know why they're after you.
HANS: Exactly. We must prevent them from attacking again. Unless we eliminate the source of evil, we won't be able to live in peace.
TASSI: So what are you gonna do?
HANS: I have a suspicion.
TASSI: Shoot!
HANS: I think it is RUSSELL. He is a business partner of mine who owes me some money.
JACOB: 'Some' money?
HANS: Quite a lot of money, actually.
TASSI: So you think he wants to get rid of his debts by killing you?
HANS: Exactly.
TASSI: Well, then let's go to RUSSELL and show him what we think of this!
HANS: I agree. Let's go.
HANS the WARR has joined the force.
The party starts their journey to the mansion of RUSSELL. On the road to RUSSELL's house, they get engaged in a fight with some punks.
