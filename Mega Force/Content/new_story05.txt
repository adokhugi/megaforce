JACOB: All right, we've got them. Let's move on to RUSSELL's mansion.
The party advances to RUSSELL's mansion and knocks on the door.
BUTLER: What can I do for you?
TASSI: We want to speak Mr. RUSSELL. Let us in!
BUTLER: Sorry, Mr. RUSSELL is not available.
TASSI: Are you kidding?
BUTLER: No, I am telling the truth. Mr. RUSSELL is not here.
TASSI: We will check ourselves whether he is really not here! C'mon, guys!
The party pushes the BUTLER away and enters the house. There they hear a voice.
SAMURAI: Intruders! How nice! Let's play with 'em and have some fun, buddies, right?
NINJA: Yeah! Yeah!
WITCH: Lovely!
