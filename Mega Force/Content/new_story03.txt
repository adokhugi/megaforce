JACOB: Phew, that was a tough battle. But luckily, we won it. Yippieh!
TASSI: Somebody must be very serious about killing HANS. Or was it just a random bunch of bandits?
JACOB: Dunno. But we certainly have to be careful.
TASSI: Yeah. So, let's bring HANS to the hospital and keep guard to prevent anybody from entering the hospital and trying to butcher him.
EVA: Well done, guys. You're good. I'm happy you're with us. It's just a few hundred metres until the hospital from here. So let's hurry up.
JACOB: All right, Ma'm.
The party advances to the hospital and hands HANS over to the doctors. Then they keep guard in the hospital garden. Indeed TASSI was right: In the night, a bunch of villains appear, trying to enter the hospital. Fortunately the party is ready to battle them.
