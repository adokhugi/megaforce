TASSI: So, you NINJA fool, tell us: who sent you? Why did you attack poor HANS on the occasion of his wedding?
NINJA: I won't tell you! We've promised our master not to betray him!
TASSI: So somebody has sent you. I knew it. You did not attack HANS by accident. But who was it? If you don't tell his name, your action won't have a pedagogical effect. We won't know who we have to fear...
JACOB: TASSI, stop it. See, he is dying. It's too late.
TASSI: OK, so let's get back to HANS and EVA. Let's see how they are doing.
JACOB: All right, Sir!
TASSI, JACOB and CARYN are moving back to the wedding scene where they see EVA performing first aid.
EVA: It seems as if it has been possible to stabilize HANS' vital parameters. Yet I think we should get to the hospital so that HANS can be fully cured! Will you come along with us?
JACOB: Yeah, let's go!
TASSI: Indeed! Let us go with EVA and bring HANS to the hospital.
EVA the ACHR has joined the force.
On their way to the hospital, the party gets ambushed by several villains.
TASSI: Hurry, JACOB! Let's defeat 'em quickly so that we won't lose too much time!
JACOB: All right, Sir!
